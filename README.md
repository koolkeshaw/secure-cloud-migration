Given a hypothetical startup in video-on-demand business. Their popularlity has grown suddenly. However, they did not patch their network accordingly. Thus making them victim of all kinds of cyber-attack.
I am writing a techincal report to move entire network of this company to cloud. 

Below is brief overview of assumptions, I have made. 
•	Company has video-on demand feature, like Netflix. Users have to pay to view a video. Hence PCI complaint.
•	Company have users from EU. Hence, GDPR compliant.
•	No security measure in place.
•	Company’s popularity has grown exponentially. So new setup must cater to increase in load
•	Assume company has sufficient budget for this task. 
•	Company’s is currently having team of 7 member. This includes two 3 in leadership roles and 4 in development role. No plan to increase team-size 
•	Details about web-application
      o	Source code of web-app cannot be changed
      o	Web-app uses MySQL for database. 
      o	Media for video-on-demand is stored locally in webserver. 

These assumptions and network architecture is available @ cloud-migration-assumption

For detailed question, please refer to Cloud-migration-question file. Credits for question goes to my Prof. Kevin Shivers


Any-suggestion on this is highly appreciated.
